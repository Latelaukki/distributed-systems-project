## Game idea

Possible idea for game: Dungeoncrawler where *n* players crawl the dungeons (ie. walk around in the arena).

## Define the architecture and roles of different nodes.

There are multiple regions in the dungeon. Gameplay for each region is handled by a dedicated gameserver.

## Decide the middleware / communication mechanism to be used to pass messages between nodes (sockets, websockets, RPC, MessageQueue system, …).

Use asynchronous communication between nodes.

Websockets between clients and gameservers.

## Events: what are they and how do you know their ‘correct’ order

Logical clocks / vector clocks will guarantee the correct order of events in the game.

## How to handle global state, do you need logging or snapshots, what about recovery?

Events are logged in the event bus (which will be used for recovery when needed).

## Is there need for coordination, what about leader elections or some other consensus decisions

TBD. Probably needed because project requirements.

## What are you going to ensure data consistency?

The event bus stores events in the correct order. Correct order of events means data consistency.

## Are you going to have replication, where, when, how

Some of the game data is replicated to
    - client 
    - game server


## TODO for friday.

Everyone writes something about the points in the design plan

- names of team members and one paragraph description of the selected topic
- more detailed description of the topic and/ or selected solution techniques/methods
- description of different nodes, their roles and functionalities
- description of messages send and received by the nodes (syntax and semantics) – this contains the ones you have identified so far some comments (one or two paragraphs about which features are you going to implement, and/or the scalability and fault tolerance aspects or goals)
